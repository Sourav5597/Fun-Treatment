The script, by actors Emily V. Gordon and Kumail Nanjiani, is semi-autobiographical. The main storyline is based on their actual courtship before they got married, and many of the events actually happened in one form or another.

It means you’ll be writing from a point of personal pain so the story will feel more “real.” However, it’s also important to make it funnier than real life.
